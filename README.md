## **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**
   - On the home screen, press the **"PLAY"** button to begin.
   - The game will pull the top Reddit post from the **AskReddit** subreddit.
   - The comments on the post are the pool of answers.

2. **Enter Your Guess**
   - You have **3 attempts** to enter a valid guess.
   - A valid guess is a word or phrase that appears in one of the top 100 comments.
   - The goal is to find the **least popular** valid answer. The fewer the upvotes, the higher your points.

3. **Scoring**
   - Points are calculated based on the answer's popularity.
   - The formula for scoring is:
     ```
     Points = 100 - ((CommentScore - LowestScore) / (HighestScore - LowestScore)) * 100
     ```
   - If you guess the least popular answer, you earn **100 points**.
   - If your guess doesn‚Äôt match any comment, you get a **"No Match"** message.

4. **Feedback**
   - After submitting a guess, the game provides instant feedback:
     - **Correct Guess**: Your points and score will be shown.
     - **Incorrect Guess**: You'll see how many attempts remain.

5. **Leaderboard**
   - Press **"LEADERBOARD"** on the home screen to see the top players.
